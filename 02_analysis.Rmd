# Read in data (merged in previous script?)

# Calc mPCs
## Heatmap of mPCs vs. covars
Remem want to make the change to make the mPC the outcome instead.

# QTL & Exposure MWASes
Remem to use mvpa variable
## QQs
## Volcanoes
## cutoff at 0.05/n_eff_metabs

# Interaction analysis (hdl ~ met*(snp OR e) + covars) on the signif mets from MWAS
# Mediation analysis 

Most of this is in the univariate-analysis script.

# (later) Sensitivity analysis (hdl ~ (e or snp) + covars)
