# Export data from User Interface (UI) to analysis workspace
This is a tutorial notebook that walks through the process of exporting selected data from the *NHLBI BioData CatalystÂ® (BDC) Powered by PIC-SURE* User Interface, or UI, into an analysis workspace. This is done using the *BDC Powered by PIC-SURE (BDC-PIC-SURE)* Application Programming Interface, or API.

------- 
 
## Introduction to exporting data into an analysis workspace with PIC-SURE

Two things are needed to export data into an analysis workspace:
1. Personalized access token: a user-specific token that tells PIC-SURE which studies a user is authorized to access
2. Query ID: a token that describes the specific query that was built in the UI, for example, if a user has selected females with body mass index between 18 and 30 from the ARIC study

Using these two components, the API can be used to export the selected data into the analysis workspace (in this case, where this Jupyter Notebook is being run). 

## Step 1: Getting your user-specific security token
**Before running this notebook, please be sure to review the "Get your security token" documentation, which exists in the [`README.md` file](../README.md). It explains how to get a security token, which is mandatory to use the PIC-SURE API.**

Follow the steps described below to get your personal security token. This security token is strictly personal, be careful not to share it with anyone

In a web browser, open the BioData Catalyst login page: https://picsure.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/, and click on the 'eRA Commons' button to log in
Click the "User Profile" tab
On the pop-up window, click the "COPY" button
Paste your token into this notebook in place of enter_your_token
This cell will create a file called token.txt containing the security token. This text file is not saved between Terra runtime sessions and it will need to be recreated each time a new Terra session is launched.

For more information about user-specific security tokens, please review the "Get your security token" section of the README.md Access to Data Using PIC-SURE API GitHub repository.

## Step 2: Setting up your notebook

### Pre-requisites for the notebook
* python 3.6 or later
* pip python package manager, already available in most systems with a python interpreter installed (link to pip)

### Install packages to connect to the PIC-SURE API
The first step to using the PIC-SURE API is to install the packages needed. The following code installs the PIC-SURE API components from GitHub, specifically:
* PIC-SURE Client
* PIC-SURE Adapter
* *BDC-PIC-SURE* Adapter

**Note that if you are using the dedicated PIC-SURE environment within the *BDC Powered by Seven Bridges (BDC-Seven Bridges)* platform, the necessary packages have already been installed.**

*Troubleshooting: if you encounter an error while installing packages or connecting to a PIC-SURE resource, try restarting your kernel and trying again.*


```{r}
my_token <- "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJMT05HX1RFUk1fVE9LRU58ZmVuY2V8NjY2NyIsIm5hbWUiOiJHRVJWSVNKIiwiaXNzIjoiZWR1LmhhcnZhcmQuaG1zLmRibWkucHNhbWEiLCJleHAiOjE3MTY5OTkzMjAsImlhdCI6MTcxNDQwNzMyMCwiZW1haWwiOiJHRVJWSVNKIiwianRpIjoid2hhdGV2ZXIifQ.R_4bWJwfFr4R6HhmwnVdNo9ug-eV-PkmP6UoMTwle1A"
writeLines(my_token, "token.txt")
```

```{r}
Sys.setenv(TAR = "/bin/tar")
options(unzip = "internal")
# devtools::install_github("hms-dbmi/pic-sure-r-adapter-hpds", ref="main", force=T, quiet=FALSE)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

## Connecting to a PIC-SURE resource
The following is required to get access to data through the PIC-SURE API: 
- Network URL
- User-specific security token

The following code specifies the network URL as the *BDC-PIC-SURE* URL and references the user-specific token saved as `token.txt`.

If you have not already retrieved your user-specific token, please refer to the "Get your security token" section of the `README.md` file and the `Workspace_setup.ipynb` file.


```{r}
PICSURE_network_URL = "https://picsure.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/picsure"
token_file <- "token.txt"
token <- scan(token_file, what = "character")
session <- picsure::bdc.initializeSession(PICSURE_network_URL, token)
session <- picsure::bdc.setResource(session = session,  resourceName = "AUTH")
```

## Step 3: Export data from a query built in the PIC-SURE UI using the Query ID

You are able to retrieve the results of a query that you have previously built using the [PIC-SURE Authorized Access UI](https://picsure.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/psamaui/). After you have built your query and filtered to your cohort of interest, open the **Select and Package Data** tool in the Tool Suite. This will allow you to copy your query ID and bring it in to a Jupyter notebook. **Note that query IDs are not permanent and may expire.**
